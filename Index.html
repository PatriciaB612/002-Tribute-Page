         <p id="preface">Sir Nicholas Winton was born in Hampstead, London in 1909. For nine months in 1939 he rescued 669 children from Nazi-occupied Czechoslovakia, taking them to the UK, thereby sparing them from the horrors of the Holocaust. </p>

          <h2>Here's a summary of his rescue work and subsequent recognition:</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>In 1938, Winton travelled to Czechoslovakia to see several refugee camps. He soon realized there was a need to help relocate the children that were caught up in the situation.
            </li>
            <li>After the Kristallnacht, the British government relaxed its immigration laws and agreed to allow in a limited number of children from Germany and Austria. Winton asked the British government to allow some Czech children to come into the UK as well.</li>
            <li>He organized the Kindertransport that took those children, mainly Jews, out Czechoslovakia before World War II began in 1939.</li>
            <li>Winton, alongside a few volunteers worked tirelessly to arrange everything the children needed, including finding host families and raising funds to cover the travel expenses of the children.</li>
            <li>The last train of children was scheduled to leave on 1 September 1939. It was cancelled because war broke out; Winton believed that ‘none of the 250 children on board was heard of again’.</li>
            <li>Although many of the children hoped to be reunited with their parents and families after the war, the majority of them discovered that their parents had been murdered in the Holocaust. It was Winton’s actions, and those of his colleagues, that prevented them from meeting the same fate.</li>
            <li>In 1988, Winton was invited to appear on That’s Life!, a television show where, to his surprise, he was reunited with some of the children he had helped.</li>
            <li>Winton was subsequently awarded many honours, including a knighthood, the Freedom of the Cities of both Prague and London, and the Order of the White Lion, the Czech Republic’s highest honour.</li>
          </ul>
